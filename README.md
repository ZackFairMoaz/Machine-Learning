# Machine-Learning

## About The Project

This project contains different handcrafted Machine Learning Models with variety of training datasets, each tailored with best suited models. Inside, you'll find a well-organized folder structure containing relevant notebooks, Flask apps with Docker, Gradio interfaces for implementation, and/or inference models(applied if applicable). All this is avalible for you to learn about basics of AI/ML development.

## Useage

Refer to Readme for each app in thier respective folders to run locally
